  AGG
      The Anti-Grain Geometry (`Agg <http://antigrain.com>`_) rendering engine, capable of rendering
      high-quality images

  EPS
      Encapsulated Postscript (`EPS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript>`_)

  JPG
      The Joint Photographic Experts Group (`JPEG
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg>`_) compression method and
      file format for photographic images

  numpy
      `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ is the standard numerical
      array library for python, the successor to Numeric and numarray.
      numpy provides fast operations for homogeneous data sets and
      common mathematical operations like correlations, standard
      deviation, fourier transforms, and convolutions.

  PDF
      Adobe's Portable Document Format (`PDF <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format>`_)

  PNG
      Portable Network Graphics (`PNG
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics>`_), a raster graphics format
      that employs lossless data compression which is more suitable
      for line art than the lossy jpg format. Unlike the gif format,
      png is not encumbered by requirements for a patent license.

  PS
      Postscript (`PS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript>`_) is a
      vector graphics ASCII text language widely used in printers and
      publishing.  Postscript was developerd by adobe systems and is
      starting to show its age: for example is does not have an alpha
      channel.  PDF was designed in part as a next-generation document
      format to replace postscript

  pyqt
      `pyqt <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt>`_ provides python wrappers for
      the :term:`Qt` and :term:`Qt4` widgets library.  Widely used on linux and
      windows; many linux distributions package this as 'python-qt3' or
      'python-qt4'.

  python
      `python <http://python.org>`_ is an object oriented interpreted
      language widely used for scripting, application development, web
      application servers, scientific computing and more.

  Qt
      `Qt <http://trolltech.com/products/qt/>`__ is a cross-platform
      application framework for desktop and embedded development.

  Qt4
      `Qt4 <http://trolltech.com/products/qt/>`__ is the most recent
      version of Qt cross-platform application framework for desktop
      and embedded development.

  raster graphics
      `Raster graphics
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics>`_, or bitmaps,
      represent an image as an array of pixels which is resolution
      dependent. Raster graphics are generally most practical for
      photo-realistic images, but do not scale easily without loss of
      quality.

  SVG
      The Scalable Vector Graphics format (`SVG
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg>`_).  An XML based vector
      graphics format supported by many web browsers.

  TIFF
      Tagged Image File Format (`TIFF
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format>`_) is a
      file format for storing images, including photographs and line
      art.

  vector graphics
      `vector graphics
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics>`_ use geometrical
      primitives based upon mathematical equations to represent images
      in computer graphics. Primitives can include points, lines,
      curves, and shapes or polygons. Vector graphics are scalable,
      which means that they can be resized without suffering from
      issues related to inherent resolution like are seen in raster
      graphics. Vector graphics are generally most practical for
      typesetting and graphic design applications.
